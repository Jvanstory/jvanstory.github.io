				<h2>Welcome</h2>
				<p>Hello there! I'm Joseph Vanstory, a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC), where I earned my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. My academic journey at UNCC has not only equipped me with a robust foundation in technology but has fueled my passion for innovation and problem-solving.</p>

				<p>	My love for technology has been a constant throughout my journey. From building and designing model rockets in middle school rocketry club to creating my own websites and apps today, I've always thrived on the excitement of learning and working with cutting-edge technologies.</p>
					
				<p>During my academic tenure, I honed my coding skills, with a strong emphasis on Python and Java. I've had the opportunity to apply these skills in practical projects, solidifying my ability to translate ideas into functional and efficient code. Now, I'm eager to take these skills beyond the academic realm and contribute to real-world challenges.</p>
					
				<p>As I step into the professional arena, I am actively seeking exciting opportunities to learn, grow, and make meaningful contributions. I am enthusiastic about becoming a valuable asset to a company that values progress, fosters a culture of continuous improvement, and embraces the dynamic nature of the tech industry.</p>
					
				<p>If you are looking for a passionate and dedicated computer science graduate ready to bring fresh perspectives and a commitment to excellence, I would love to connect! I am open to networking, mentorship, and exploring opportunities that align with my eagerness to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
					
				<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile, and I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals in the tech community!</p>
