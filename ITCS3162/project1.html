			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				The primary question I seek to address through this dataset pertains to the evolving nature of weather conditions in recent years. Specifically, I am interested in discerning whether these conditions have been on a trajectory of deterioration or have, for the most part, maintained a stable pattern. My overarching goal in analyzing this data is to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the temporal shifts in weather patterns.
			</p>
			<p>
				By uncovering any discernible trends or changes in weather conditions, I hope to contribute to a more informed perspective on what the future may hold in terms of climate and meteorological phenomena. This knowledge is invaluable, as it will enable me and others to take proactive measures and make informed decisions in response to both deteriorating and improving weather conditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In essence, the insights derived from this analysis will empower us to adapt and prepare for the challenges that changing weather can pose. Whether it entails fortifying infrastructure against extreme weather events, implementing sustainable farming practices in response to altered precipitation patterns, or simply being better equipped to plan daily activities, a deeper understanding of evolving weather conditions is essential for our resilience and preparedness in an ever-changing world.

			<h2>Introduce the Data</h2>
			<p>
				I am utilizing data to address my inquiry, and you can access this dataset via the following link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-weather-events">Weather Dataset</a>. This dataset encompasses a comprehensive collection of information regarding weather incidents in the United States, spanning across 49 states, with data available from January 2016 to December 2022. The dataset draws from a network of 2,071 airport-based weather stations, ensuring a robust and extensive coverage of weather-related events.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within this dataset, you will find data on various weather events, including but not limited to Severe Cold, Fog, Hail, Rain, Snow, Storm, and Other Precipitation. Moreover, it provides valuable insights into the severity levels of these events, categorized as light, moderate, heavy, or severe. This rich and diverse dataset will serve as the foundation for my analysis, enabling a comprehensive examination of weather conditions and trends over the specified time frame.
