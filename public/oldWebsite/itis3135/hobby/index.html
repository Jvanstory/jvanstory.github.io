            <p>I will also go over to friend's houses or apartments to play games in person with them. They will also come over to be able to play games in person. We will usually play the wii or the switch if we are going to each others places.</p>

            <p>The reason I play games is because I enjoy them. I enjoy the problem solving aspects or the fun of fps games. My favorite game type is ones that allow you to use your imagination like minecraft.</p><br>
            <p>I play the wii because I really enjoyed playing it when I was younger. I also play the switch because it is very similar to the wii and has games like mario kart. The biggest reason I like playing on the wii and switch is that I am able to play them with friends when we are together.</p>
